The indexer then processes the repositories, one at a time, starting with the repository that was most recently committed to. For each repository, it determines if a full indexing is needed or just an incremental indexing is sufficient to catch up since the last indexing operation. It then goes down the list of files and processes them for indexing. Only files that need to be indexed are extracted. For example, large binary files are not extracted as they would be indexed anyaway. As the indexers crawl a repository, it would skip any file that is greater than 1 MB. To index a file it has to be UTF8 text.Files are scanned for file encoding and converted to UTF8 if required.
